## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to prove to our investors that a bike sharing program in Des Moines would be a fruitful investment. To do so we have allocated a large set of data from the CitiBike records then we created an analysis from this data to prove our statement.
 
We focused our analysis on the following:
 
- Peak Hours of Bike usage
 
- Customers vs Subscribers
 
- Number of trips made by Day and Hour
 
- Duration of Trips by Hour and Minute
 
- Gender of Customers
 
 
Utilizing the Software Tableau and a little bit of the Python Library known as pandas we cleaned the data and created an assortment of data visualizations to help illustrate our findings.
 
 
## Results
 
### Trip Duration

- The above line graph illustrates how long the bikes are used for as well as the quantity of bikes being used for that amount of time. The data reflects that the citi bike users are using as much as 3000 bikes for trips lasting 4 - 6 hours. This is great information because presents data that conveys the regular usage of this product/service
 
 
### Peak Hours of Bike Usage

- The above chart displays the bike usage according to hour. This data shows that most of the usage occurs during the early hours and later hours of the day. But it also shows that for the month of august at 6 pm over 220K customers had used the service collectively. This establishes helps us convey the consistent trend that this service is utilized and a worthy investment
 
### Subscribers and Regular Customers

- The above Pie chart splits our customers into two categories, Subscribers and your regular customer. The pie chart shows that most of the bike users are or have become subscribers. They will make up most of our analysis. This is very reassuring because it conveys that most customers are happy with the service and tend to opt into the subscription which means more income for everyone. It also helps to illustrate the trend that most customers are going to be here to stay and rely on this service
 
### Weekday analysis by hour
![alt text](https://github.com/sebcampos/bikesharing/blob/master/images/TripsbyWeekdayperHour.png?raw=true)
 
- The heat map above shows that at any time during the day we can expect at least 360 customers using the service. We can also expect that during the week the high points are again in the mornings and evenings, perhaps they are related to commutes, on the weekends there is less of a demand during these hours and the usage is spread out more evenley. I believe these customers need bikes for their commute! If this is the case we can aim to make more bikes available during this time to ensure as much usage as possible.
 
 
### Trip Duration by Gender
![alt text](https://github.com/sebcampos/bikesharing/blob/master/images/CheckoutTimesbyGender.png?raw=true)
 
- The above chart is similar to our original but also categorizes the usage according to gender. This Chart is very insightful because it gives us a clear depiction of our demographic. We can easily see that men are using bikes the most and will make up most of our data. Perhaps this info will be useful when advertising our service
 
### Weekday analysis by Gender
![alt text](https://github.com/sebcampos/bikesharing/blob/master/images/TripsbyGender_WeekdayperHour_.png?raw=true)
 
- The above heatmap confirms that during the week mostly men are using the service, but it also shows that women are using these bikes during the same hours possibly for the same commute purposes. If we could advertise the service to women or make it more available to them our bike usage might double!
 
### Bike Usage Based on Weekday and Gender
![alt text](https://github.com/sebcampos/bikesharing/blob/master/images/UserTripsbyGenderbyWeekday.png?raw=true)
 
- The Heat Map above shows us that our male subscribers make up the bulk of our trips during the week. While our regular customers are pretty consistently making up a lower percentage of these trips.we can also see that monday through friday has a heavy usage for these users, This is also reflected for our women subscribers. Looks like our subscribers are active people who use these bikes regularly throughout the week, this is fantastic because most of our users are consistent subscribers.
 
 
 
## Summary
The bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a great business proposal, there is a high demand for bikes especially during the weekdays. With the service in place most customers end up subscribing and using the service regularly.
 
## Suggested Visualizations
- One interesting set of data would be to see cumulative costs of bike maintenence over time
- Another interesting set of data would be to see would be the relationship between our commmuting customers and the trafic in those areas. perhaps this venture is more fruitful in high traffic areas
