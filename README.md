## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to prove to our investors that a bike sharing program in Des Moines would be a fruitful investment. To do so we have allocated a large set of data from the CitiBike records then we created an analysis from this data to prove our statement.

We focused our analysis on the following:

- Peak Hours of Bike usage

- Customers vs Subscribers

- Number of trips made by Day and Hour

- Duration of Trips by Hour and Minute

- Gender of Customers


Utilizing the Software Tableau and a little bit of the Python Library known as pandas we cleaned the data and created an assortment of data visualizations to help illustrate our findings.
